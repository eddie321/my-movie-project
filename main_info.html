                        <p style="height: 250px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 2px solid #8e793e;">I got to see a screening of this in Boston, and let me admit to the fact that I consider this film
                            a masterpiece. It is a rare entry into the market: an ambitious film, a gamble that, sadly, makes
                            me question how much success it could garner in the mainstream box-office. Charlie Kaufman, however,
                            is not a screenwriter/director who inherently aims his sights on the box-office or the mainstream
                            (anybody who questions this has to question Being John Malkovich). Instead, his greatest strength
                            is a boundless creativity and insight into the qualities of humanity, and Synecdoche, New York
                            is no exception. Rather, it is the apex of Kaufman at his most insightful, his most ambitious,
                            and (as his directorial debut) his most hauntingly beautiful. The plot itself is a contradiction
                            of simplicity and complexity: to say that it is about Philip Seymour Hoffman trying to put on
                            a larger than life play is an accurate statement, yet it completely fails to capture what Synecdoche,
                            New York tries to convey. It is not a conventional film, but instead it is ambitious: a mixture
                            of conventional narrative and surrealist cinema, one where the beauty of the film does not solely
                            lie upon the plot, but the way every minute quality of the film ties together to form the tapestry.
                            The actors all do their parts brilliantly. I am hard-pressed to find any performance that was
                            weak or, for that matter, standard of the Hollywood formula. Hoffman is brilliant in a role that
                            utilizes his physical and acting gifts, and he takes the character through the spectrum of its
                            possibilities. All the other actors also performed brilliantly, although what struck me as wonderful
                            about the acting choices are that the majority of the actors present are not "glamorized" for
                            the screen. Rather, the blemishes, the age, and the imperfections that make them ordinary are
                            ever present in the film, making Synecdoche, New York seem beautiful in a strange, "dirty" way.
                            Much like a city, its majesty lies not in grungy street corners or clogged rain gutters, but
                            in the whole image that is comprised of such small, necessary imperfections. And that, ultimately,
                            is why Synecdoche, New York is such an ambitious, beautiful film. It is not a perfectly crafted
                            standard screenplay, nor a perfectly executed piece of cinema. At least, Kaufman's work is not
                            perfect under the current criteria of modern cinema. Synecdoche, New York is a gamble; a mixture
                            of images and music and dialogue and acting that follows Kaufman's heart and his meditations
                            on several ideas: namely, those on life and death and the connections all around us. It is dark
                            yet funny, evocative and haunting. It is perfect in being a work of art that tempts us to find
                            explanation, yet ultimately needs none compared to the feelings they evoke in us. Viewers who
                            are looking to see the difference between "art" and "entertainment" need only see Synecdoche.</p>

                        <p style="height: 250px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 2px solid #8e793e;">What a trip. You can't expect a conventional picture from Charlie Kaufman, but this was super weird!
                            So weird that half the people left the theatre before the end, either confused or offended by
                            what they saw. Poor Charlie witnessed the whole scene and I suspect it really got to him. The
                            film's very much Spike Jonze in style, but grander and more ambitious than Malkovich and Adaptation.
                            The first hour is hilarious, next half an hour is still good and you're struggling not to lose
                            threads, the last half an hour gets really messy and tends to drag a bit. It might be due to
                            Charlie's inexperience as a director, or it might be intentional and a means to express one of
                            the points of the film (futility and dragging of time), or the topics simply grew too difficult
                            to deal with, but it seems to me that the last part could have been made a bit more compact for
                            a stronger impression. Seven to ten minutes less would have helped, if that was possible. Perhaps
                            Jonze would have done a better job in terms of pacing and craftsmanship, but the content is still
                            really strong. The film had been five years in the making and you can feel the issues that Kaufman
                            wanted to address brimming over. Illness, death, transience, love, relationships, passion, devotion,
                            art, theatre, identity, hope, so many topics dealt with in a painfully sincere way. You both
                            laugh and get emotionally affected all the time along with being confused by the twists of the
                            plot and the grotesqueness of the imagery. You get many 'this is so true' moments that you completely
                            identify with and then you suddenly get struck by a completely surreal scene. The film certainly
                            reinforced my impression of Kaufman as a bastard son of Woody Allen and Tom Stoppard. The cast
                            is wonderful. Philip Seymour Hoffman has to be singled out for his magnificent performance. I
                            have never been much of a fan of his and I was somewhat bothered by the idea of him as a lead
                            in the next Kaufman movie. I didn't think he had a presence for that, but did he prove me wrong!
                            Appearing in virtually every scene, the man has carried this film on his shoulders. He has created
                            a completely lovable and ludicrous character and conveyed Kaufman's ideas splendidly. Catherine
                            Keener is as fun and adorable as ever! As a fan, I was really overwhelmed by this experience.
                            I saw it two nights in a row, and spent hours discussing it with friends. The film is a bit difficult
                            to comprehend instantaneously and Kaufman himself insists it requires a second watching. It is
                            an amazing picture, rarely thought-provoking, and I can't wait to see it for the third time.</p>
